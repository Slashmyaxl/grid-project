# grid-project

In this final project of the Intermediate HTML/CSS section of "The Odin Project" curriculum, I will focus on designing a layout using CSS Grid. I will also demonstrate my understanding of appropriate uses of Flexbox within 'Grid' areas, proper uses of HTML elements other than 'div,' and utilizing external assets such as icons.
